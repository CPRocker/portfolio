# Carson Price's Portfolio Website

This is a repo for housing my personal portfolio website built using Deno Fresh.

## Running the Project

### Run Locally

Make sure to install Deno:

Then start the project:

```bash
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
